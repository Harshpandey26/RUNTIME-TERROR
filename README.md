# RUNTIME-TERROR
Hello Judges, We the Run Time terror team want to share some of the information about our website and our experience in making this website.

1.  How to run the website locally?
->To run the website locally, you should go to the index.html file and click on it as it is the home page of our website. You can go to different web pages by clicking on the options given on the navbar or by clicking on the navigation links given in the footer section. I had used <a> tag to link the web pages with the homepage.


2. References which you may have used?
-> I have taken the reference of youtube, pixabay, bootstrap, W3school, Font awesome, Icons8  website. I have watched many videos related to CSS and javascript on youtube. I had taken the stock-free images from the pixabay website. I had used bootstrap to make the navbar of my website. I had taken some of the code like the progress bar and codes of different shades of colors from W3school. I had used FontAwesome icons like the medikit, hospital, etc. From the icons8 website I had downloaded many icons like the doctor, patient, Gmail, Twitter, Facebook icons used on the login page.


3. CSS/JS frameworks?
->I have mainly used javascript in two sections. Firstly, I had used javascript in the home page to make the animation in patient cured count (by using jquery). Secondly, in login page to swiping through login and signup. I had also used  overflow:hidden so that the other section gets hidden if we swipe to the other section(like if we click on sign up login get hidden).
I had used a linear gradient for giving two or more shades of color in 1 background. I had also used transform in CSS to translate y that is if we put our cursor on that the content will move slightly upward. I had used many other common CSS features to make my website more attractive and eye-catching.


4. How your website justifies the theme you have selected??
->Our website aims to act as a one-stop solution for all the medical needs and requirements of a customer.
Doogle aims to provide the solution for every medical need of a patient with just one click. And thus, we decided to consolidate the various requirements, like appointments, tests, pharmaceutical drugs, etc in one place itself.
Doogle also aims at increasing the visibility of doctors working through smaller clinics and there is a separate section for appointments with doctors from clinics besides the section for appointments with doctors working through hospitals.
 Not just this, to keep in mind, the present scenario of the pandemic, we also accommodated databases for various resources concerning Covid-19.
Two of our members have worked as volunteers under one of the reputed organizations working towards covid relief and have seen how difficult it is to find active leads and reliable sources for various requirements. Thus, to become a part of the solution, we took to work on this website.
Our website justifies the theme we selected because the idea aims at making the struggle of a patient easier. Our vision involves Doogle being a non-profit website that adapts to the ever-changing needs and requirements of the people.


5. What problems you faced and how you resolved it?
->The biggest problem was that the time given was very little to make the website, We gave our Level best to make this website attractive and up to the mark. Many times small errors like using different names of class in HTML and CSS by mistake give us many problems. I also wanted to use API for the payment option and to get information about the vaccine but lastly, I added the mail alerts and telegram links to give information about vaccines to the users. I also got confused about how to remove the hyperlink underline if I had added a link using <a> tag, the solution was that in CSS I used text-decoration: none  to remove the hyperlink underline.  The foremost problem we faced was working with GitHub, as none of us had an experience of using it earlier. We overcome this issue by searching about it over internet , getting guidance from our senior and elder brother.


6. What new things you learned by making this website
-> First and the most important thing we learned while working on this project is cooperation and teamwork. We also came across some of the advance things about web development, searching curiously about these topics over internet while working on this project really helped us to learn a lot more about website development. Git and GitHub are also the topics we worked on and learned a lot about, our experience of using it was great , we explored number of features of it and this project really helped us to learn.We learned many things while making this website. The second thing was the font awesome icons. The second thing was how to make animations using jquery. Fourthly about the linear gradient part i.e how to add two shades of color in one background using a linear gradient. Fivethly I learned how to hide text and swipe the text using javascript functions. And I also learned how to remove the hyperlink underline which I had already told you in the previous question. Lastly, we also learned how to add a navbar using bootstrap.
